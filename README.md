# Projects-in-Data-Analytics
Accurate detection for high-risk credit applicants.

Goals of this project are: 
- provide actionable insights for informed decision making
- understand the key elements influencing the credit risks (highly significant features)
- correctly classify the clients that will default

To carry out this project, I have implemented the following Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, GlmnNet, Support Vector Machine, Classification Tree and Linear Discriminant Analysis.
